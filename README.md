The Problem:
The task involves classifying companies based on their descriptions, sectors, niches, and other relevant information by matching them to labels. At first glance, this seems straightforward: read data, compare it with predefined labels, and update the records. However, several challenges needed to be addressed, including text variation (e.g., different word forms like "running" vs "run") and ensuring accurate matching even with potentially inconsistent data.
The solution needed to:
1.	Process company data from an Excel file.
2.	Use natural language processing (NLP) to match company descriptions to predefined labels.
3.	Update the Excel file with the matched labels.
Here’s where my reasoning came into play:
Step 1: Breaking Down the Task into Components
Instead of tackling the problem in a single go, I first broke it down into manageable pieces. I asked myself the following questions:
•	How do I read and process the Excel files efficiently? I needed a way to access the company data from Excel and update it with the matched labels. For this, Apache POI was an obvious choice, as it’s a robust library for handling Excel files in Java.
•	How do I ensure accurate matching between company descriptions and labels? One major challenge was that company descriptions and labels could use different word forms (e.g., "services" vs. "service"). A lemmatizer was needed to reduce words to their base form so that these variations wouldn’t prevent matches.
•	What structure would be best to store and compare the data? A map of labels to words (using a Map<String, Set<String>>) seemed like a good structure because it allows for fast lookup and easy comparison. Each label would map to a set of words, which I could use to check if a company’s description contains any of these words.

Step 2: The Solution Components
Each class in the solution had a specific role, and I carefully designed them to tackle a distinct aspect of the problem:
1. Companies Class – Managing the Flow
The Companies class serves as the orchestrator. It handles reading the Excel file, processing each company’s data, matching it with labels, and writing the matched labels back to the file. Here’s why this structure made sense:
•	The core logic involves reading the data (company descriptions) and matching it with predefined labels, which is central to the problem. Keeping this logic in a dedicated class, Companies, made the code clear and modular.
•	I also decided to split the matching and updating logic into its own method (updateExcelWithMatchedLabels()), so I could focus on the matching process separately from the rest of the flow.
Reasoning for this structure: This class ensures that all interactions between Excel files and labels are managed centrally. I chose this structure to ensure that changes (e.g., changing how labels are processed or how data is read) can be made easily without disrupting the flow of the program.
2. ExcelReader Class – Processing and Reading Labels
The ExcelReader class is responsible for reading the label data from an Excel file, preprocessing it (lemmatizing), and storing it in a way that’s easy to search during the matching process. The class also has methods to retrieve preprocessed labels when needed.
•	The preprocessLabels() method reads the Excel file containing the labels, applies lemmatization, and stores the lemmatized version of each label in a separate file. It also creates a map (labelMapWords) where each label is linked to its corresponding set of lemmatized words.
•	The readLemmatizedLabels() method loads the preprocessed label file and populates the map again, so the Companies class can use it for matching.
Reasoning for this structure: I separated the logic for reading and processing labels into a different class to maintain separation of concerns. The Companies class should not be burdened with the complexities of reading and preprocessing labels; this is the responsibility of the ExcelReader class. This way, if I need to change how labels are processed, I can modify ExcelReader without affecting the rest of the code.

Step 3: Matching and Writing Data Back to Excel
Once the company descriptions and labels were lemmatized, the matching process began. The Companies class compares the lemmatized company text with the lemmatized labels.
I chose to use a set-based approach for matching: each label’s lemmatized form is stored as a set of words, and I check if any of those words appear in the company’s description.
This approach allows for efficient matching. If a word from the company’s description is found in the set of lemmatized words associated with a label, I add that label to the list of matched labels for that company.
Reasoning for this structure: I used a set-based comparison because it’s a fast and effective way to check for common words between two collections. Using sets ensures that duplicate words don’t affect the matching process.


Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed

•	Label Variations: One of the main challenges was ensuring that different word forms (e.g., "run" vs "running") didn’t prevent labels from matching. Lemmatization solved this problem, but I had to carefully ensure that the lemmatizer worked correctly and didn’t miss any edge cases. I used a default POS tag for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, I might need to refine this approach.

•	Handling Excel Files: Another challenge was dealing with Excel files that might not always be in the expected format. I had to ensure that the "Matched Labels" column was added correctly and that the program didn’t overwrite any existing data in the file. To handle this, I checked if the column existed and added it if necessary.

•	Efficiency: With larger datasets, efficiency could become a concern. In the current approach, the company descriptions and labels are loaded into memory at once, which could be improved by processing data in chunks. In future versions, I might explore more memory-efficient techniques for large datasets.

Conclusion

In this project, my approach to solving the problem was by breaking it down into smaller tasks, each with a specific focus:
1.	Reading the data (with ExcelReader).
2.	Lemmatizing the text (with OpenNLPLematizer).
3.	Matching the company data to labels (with Companies).
4.	Updating the Excel file with the results.

By focusing on simplicity (using OpenNLP for lemmatization, leveraging Apache POI for Excel processing), I created a solution that balances accuracy and efficiency. The challenges were addressed by keeping things flexible and ensuring that the logic was isolated in different classes.

I’m happy with the solution because it’s clean, organized, and easy to maintain. It’s also scalable: should the dataset grow or require more sophisticated processing, I can update the respective classes without affecting the rest of the flow.
